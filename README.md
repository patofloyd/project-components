# Project Components

*The following is guidelines for a suggested structure and design for components*

## Root
Export the path with `module.exports = __dirname;` in your index.js file so that the [import tasks](https://github.com/pedric/spacecraft-starterkit#import-components) in Spacecraft can reach your files.

Care about your friends by setting up changelog-, license- and readme files for your component.

## Folders

### Docs
Add a markdown for your component that will be visible in the documentation naviagtion for the styleuide here, if it's specific documentation for the component only it's suggested that you put it in the viem-folder (see below).

### Icons
SVG icons goes here. Components that not uses any icons can skip this folder.

### Img
Images goes here. Probably there will be some placeholder images here, provide guidelines and info in the [documentation](#docs). Components that not uses any images can skip this folder.

### js
Here you'll put Javascript for the component, in Spacecraft you can (and are suggested to) isolate your JS to the component by making a module as [described here](https://github.com/pedric/spacecraft-starterkit#javascript).

### View
This is the place for:

• HTML (Twig)

• CSS (SCSS)

• Config (JSON)

• Readme (md)

Twig is Spacecraft´s default but Nunjucks, Handlebars etc can be used. This is set in Spacecraft´s config for your project.
